# [HELML (Header-Like Markup Language)](https://github.com/dynoser/HELML/)

![helml-logo](https://github.com/dynoser/HELML/raw/master/logo/icon.png)

> HELML is a lightweight markup language designed for array serialization and configuration descriptions, similar to HTTP headers. It provides a simple syntax for encoding arrays of arbitrary structure, making it particularly useful in scenarios where JSON falls short, such as handling binary data and supporting comments.

> vc85 encoding is a variation of base85 (85-character chatset) and is compatible with ASCII85.

# [Dubla encoding](https://github.com/dynoser/dubla)

![dubla-logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynoser/dubla-vscode-plugin/main/images/icon.png)

> Dubla encoding scheme allows to almost halve the number of characters that the text takes up.
This is achieved by using Base-1024 encoding and using compression (AltBase64, Deflate).

- [VsCode plugin (marketplace)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dynoser.dubla)
- [VsCode plugin (sources)](https://github.com/dynoser/dubla-vscode-plugin)

> Inside the Double encoding, an algorithm similar to base64alt (on AltBase64) is used, which will be discussed below:

# [AltBase64](https://github.com/dynoser/base64alt)

![altbase64](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynoser/base64alt/main/doc/icon.png)

> The altbase64 encoding algorithm is based on a base64 charset, but encodes data according to different principles. In fact, it is a text compression algorithm that makes the encoded text look similar to the text before encoding. Designed for encoding texts based on Latin and Cyrillic alphabet.

- [TypeScript (one file)](https://github.com/dynoser/dubla-vscode-plugin/blob/main/src/altbase64.ts)
> Unlike AltBase64, the base64alt algorithm combines three different encoding options: base64 classic, AltBase64,
and base64 with deflate compression (gzip). The base64alt decoder is backward compatible with base64-classic encoding.
