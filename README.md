# [HELML (Header-Like Markup Language)](https://github.com/dynoser/HELML/)

![helml-logo](https://github.com/dynoser/HELML/raw/master/logo/icon.png)

> HELML is a lightweight markup language designed for array serialization and configuration descriptions, similar to HTTP headers. It provides a simple syntax for encoding arrays of arbitrary structure, making it particularly useful in scenarios where JSON falls short, such as handling binary data and supporting comments.
